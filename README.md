# Rails Responsive Table

**[Rails Responsive Table](https://github.com/CodiTramuntana/ct_table_for)** is a rails table builder for an ActiveRecord collection.

## Optional gems

* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/)
* [Ransack](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack)
* [Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip)
* [CanCanCan](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan)

## Installation

Add it to your Gemfile:

`gem 'ct_table_for', '~> 0.1.8'`

Then:

`bundle`

Then require the CSS in your `application.css` file:

```css
/*
 *= require table_for
 */
```

or in sass

```sass
@import "table_for"
```

## Usage

To get started, just use the `table_for_for` helper. Here's an example:

```erb
<%= table_for Model, @collection %>
```

### Customizing

Create config variables in your app's /config/initializers/ct_table_for.rb

```ruby
CtTableFor.setup do |config|
  config.table_for_wrapper_default_class = "table-responsive"
  config.table_for_default_class = "table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed table-hover"
  config.table_for_breakpoint = "992px" # or could be done by sass
  config.table_for_icon_font = "fa"
  config.table_for_action_icons = {show: "eye", edit: "pencil", destroy: "trash"}
  config.table_for_numeric_percent_precision = 2

end
```
You can also define the breakpoint in your `sass` before importing `table_for`:

```sass
$table-for-breakpoint: 768px;
@import "table_for"
```


## Development

To develop the Gem, clone this repo and in your Rails Test application edit the `Gemfile` and edit the path to your local repo:

```
gem 'table_for', path: '/home/user/path/to/table_for'
```
